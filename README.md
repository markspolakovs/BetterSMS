# BetterSMS

## A Chrome/Firefox(/Edge?) extension to improve some things about the SMS interface

### Important Note

Since some people might be getting concerned:

 * This extension does not "hack" SMS
 * There is **no way** to access anyone's data except your own using the extension
 * This extension does not break any laws (that I am aware of)
 * This extension only uses APIs (code hooks) that SMS already makes available

### Installing

For now the extension is not available on Chrome Web Store / AMO, so the only way is to install a development build. For now development builds are only available for Chrome, Firefox builds are coming soon.

To download a development build, visit https://github.com/markspolakovs/BetterSMS/releases, find the latest release, download the `.crx` file, go to `chrome://extensions`, and drag-and-drop the `.crx` file onto the Chrome page.
